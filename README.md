# An App for tracking Habits

This app is for tracking habits. Both the front end and the backend use JavaScript. It is built using the [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack). That is: MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS. 

Some other cool technologies you'll find used are
 - Service Workers
 - Webpack
 - Babel
 - Redux
 - Web Push Notifications
 - Jenkins
 - Docker
 - Kubernetes & Helm

## Getting started
To get started though, you don't need all that. To start, you'll simply need nodejs installed. (check the first line of the Dockerfile for the exact version).

Then, `cd` into the src direct, and run `npm install`. 

To start the server, run `npm run serve`. 

To start the build (the thing that compiles your JS, SCSS, and other resources), run `npm run dev`.

For production, there are other commands.

## Author's note
In a way, this application serves as a record for [me](https://allenmuncy.com), my evolution as a developer from 2017 to 2020. The project actually predates the initial commit on this reposity. The back end was built originally using a PHP and a MySQL Database. I kept most of the front end and started fresh in a new repository, which is this one. I'm not brave enough to look at the old, if I could even find it.
